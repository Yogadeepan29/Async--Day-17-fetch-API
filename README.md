In this Repository, I have completed the Day 17 Async programming - Restcountries & Weather using the fetch API task

==> Task-1 ( Fetch API )

I have built a web page, that displays 250 countries' details and information on the screen using  HTML, DOM, CSS, Bootstrap and Advanced Javascript.

    * In this task I have used two APIs to get countries and weather details
        * Rest Countries API - https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
        * Open Weather API - https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}
    * All the HTML elements are created using DOM.
    * Used fetch() API to get data from rest countries and open weather.
    * Bootstrap cards were used to display the data on the screen .
    * The values getted from the API's are  Country Name, Region, Capital, Lattitude & Longitude, Country Code, Population, Temperature, Pressure, Humidity and Windspeed.
    * This page is also Responsive on all screens
